# CS354 Final Project

This is my final project entry for CS354. The goal of the project is to produce dynamic lighting with 2D using WebGL and [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/).
The project currently uses Pokemon tiles to simulate dynamic lighting within a tileset that attempts to emulate 3D with 2D tiles

You can see the project in action [here](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/samuelf/dynamic_lighting/). 

Note: The live demo build won't be updated as development progresses. This will be updated for the progress report (12/1), the presentation (12/4), and at turn in (12/11)

I've currently implemented a 'smart' tiling system as well as dynamic shading based on a dynamically positioned sun, as well as some interactive controls to determine sunlight position.

Objects such as houses are soon to follow, followed by casting shadows and then support for different types of lights.
