# CS354 Final Project

This is my final project entry for CS354. The goal of the project is to produce dynamic lighting with 2D using WebGL and [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/).
The project currently uses Pokemon tiles to simulate dynamic lighting within a tileset that attempts to emulate 3D with 2D tiles

You can see the project in action [here](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/samuelf/dynamic_lighting/)

Report for CS 354 is [here](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/samuelf/dynamic_lighting/report/)

Note: The live demo build won't actively be updated as development progresses. This will be updated for the progress report (12/1), the presentation (12/4), and at turn in (12/11)

I've currently implemented
* 'smart' tiling system
* dynamic shading based on a dynamically positioned sun (directional light) 
* some interactive controls to determine sunlight position
* Objects spanning multiple tiles (buildings)
* support for different types of lights

Not yet implemented: 
* casting shadows
